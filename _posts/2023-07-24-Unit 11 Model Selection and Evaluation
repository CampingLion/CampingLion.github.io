## Observations
The team project played an enormous contribution to understanding how a CNN can be used in the application of image classification. 
This is a critical enabler of machine vision. Working with the team it was necessary to divide the task such that each team member could contribute in the most efficient way possible. 
On reflection, the development, testing and validation of the model is a rigorous task, both in terms of coding as well as in ensuring that sensible steps are followed. 
It will be critical to experiment with different datasets in order to learn how to develop more complex CNNs.
