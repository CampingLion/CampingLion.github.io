It is clear that, although there are proponents of Industry 4.0 and the benefits it might bring, there are some who equally express concern about its impacts on our economies and our societies, more generally (Schwab, 2016) 

While its benefits are normally cited in terms of the efficiencies it will deliver in our daily lives, for example in the ordering and purchasing of goods and services, Schwab (2016) explains that gains will also be made by means of the increased value that new technology will bring to existing goods and services. 

In the field of medical devices, the advent of Industry 4.0 is leading to advancements in the areas of, e.g., digitisation, ergonomics and augmented reality (Popov et al, 2022).

However, there are notable concerns about advancements in technology as an enabler for greater opportunity to carry out cyberattacks: 

One example of an incident in the field of medical devices (Critical Software) demonstrates how reliance on a system that has the capability of storing and transmitting patient and drug library data could lead to significant patient risk. In this case, a manufacturer was obliged to mitigate for this potential failure to avoid a recall of the device:

In September 2022, Baxter Medical published an alert relating to two of its infusion pumps, in which multiple vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain sensitive data, perform a man-in-the-middle attack, or cause a denial-of-service condition in the device. As a temporary mitigation, users were recommended to reset network settings, delete the drug library and clear the history log before decommissioning the device (NHS Digital, 2022). 

This incident is an example of how vulnerabilities in connected systems can be exploited by bad actors and why cybersecurity will be an ever-increasing focus of medical device manufacturers with the advent of Industry 4.0.
