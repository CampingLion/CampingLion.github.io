It is clear that, although there are proponents of Industry 4.0 and the benefits it might bring, there are some who equally express concern about its impacts on our economies and our societies, more generally (Schwab, 2016) 

While its benefits are normally cited in terms of the efficiencies it will deliver in our daily lives, for example in the ordering and purchasing of goods and services, Schwab (2016) explains that gains will also be made by means of the increased value that new technology will bring to existing goods and services. 

In the field of medical devices, the advent of Industry 4.0 is leading to advancements in the areas of, e.g., digitisation, ergonomics and augmented reality (Popov et al, 2022).

However, there are notable concerns about advancements in technology as an enabler for greater opportunity to carry out cyberattacks: 

One example of an incident in the field of medical devices (Critical Software) demonstrates how reliance on a system that has the capability of storing and transmitting patient and drug library data could lead to significant patient risk. In this case, a manufacturer was obliged to mitigate for this potential failure to avoid a recall of the device:

In September 2022, Baxter Medical published an alert relating to two of its infusion pumps, in which multiple vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain sensitive data, perform a man-in-the-middle attack, or cause a denial-of-service condition in the device. As a temporary mitigation, users were recommended to reset network settings, delete the drug library and clear the history log before decommissioning the device (NHS Digital, 2022). 

This incident is an example of how vulnerabilities in connected systems can be exploited by bad actors and why cybersecurity will be an ever-increasing focus of medical device manufacturers with the advent of Industry 4.0.

Hello Rachel ,
I really enjoyed reading your initial post. I consider significant the fact that you highlighted both the benefits that the constant advancement of technology will bring about as well as some concerns in regards with the malicious usage of the industrial revolution. You have clearly demonstrated some instances of our daily lives in which the industrial revolution seems valuable. Ιn addition to that, you have also introduced an instance where some patients' personal data were in a vulnerable position as an unauthorized individual could easily invade the system and obtain access to the data.

However, personally speaking I believe that you have focused exclusively within the medical field. I strongly consider that cybersecurity is an issue that should be applied strictly in all sectors if we desire to prevent such incidents. What is your opinion in relevance to that?

Rachel,

Thank you for your post regarding the issues in relation to cyber-security and how it impacted Baxter Medical it was very informative. Given that Ottawa hospital has over 1,860 of these pumps in use, Brose et al. (2021) begins to provide an idea of the scale of the issue.

When reviewing your post, I was a little uncertain regarding the timeframe you indicated. My research suggests that the issues with the infusion pumps was in 2021 rather than in 2022 as you suggested. This is supported by, SD Biosensor Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Home Tests : Biomedical Safety & Standards (lww.com) , Pumps (2022). In this regard I was wondering if there had possibly been more than one incident?

With respect to the vulnerabilities in the software systems of the technology, I do feel that this is potentially a major issue. Whilst, one of the benefits however was the release of addition guidance notes by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) regarding how to ‘better’ secure technology components.

That said do you feel that given the number of lines of code that are now becoming common in software applications is there truly a way to ensure that vulnerabilities can be adequately guarded against.? In my opinion there is potential scope for improvement by utilising blockchain technologies and the use of individual digital identities. I do accept that Blockchain has a number of issues to overcome, for instance latency times, Khan et al. (2020). Obviously management of digital identities has certain problems with distrust and fears of being surveilled being amongst the notable issues, Gelb et al. (2018). Unfortunately, this causes such schemes to receive a degree of distrust and presents challenges with being adopted. However, I expect in time this will change, because more people are readily accepting more and more technological solutions. It would be interesting to know your thoughts on this.

Hello Rachel,

Thank you for sharing your perspective on Industry 4.0 and its potential benefits and concerns. It's important to consider both the positive and negative impacts on our economies and societies (Schwab, 2016).

I agree that Industry 4.0 can bring efficiencies to our daily lives and enhance the value of goods and services through technological advancements (Schwab, 2016). In the medical device field, advancements in digitization, ergonomics, and augmented reality have the potential to transform healthcare (Popov et al., 2022).

However, cybersecurity is a significant concern in the era of Industry 4.0. The example you mentioned involving Baxter Medical's infusion pumps demonstrates the risks of interconnected systems in healthcare (NHS Digital, 2022). Cyberattacks can lead to compromised patient data and harm to patients. It is crucial for medical device manufacturers to prioritize cybersecurity measures.

Given the significance of this issue, I would like to delve further into the topic of cybersecurity within the framework of Industry 4.0. How do you believe the healthcare industry can effectively tackle the growing cybersecurity challenges associated with the integration of advanced technologies? Are there any specific strategies or measures you think should be implemented to mitigate these risks?

Thank you for your contribution, and I look forward to hearing your insights.

### Summary post
by Rachel Mead - Monday, 22 May 2023, 10:31 PM

In my initial post, I presented the case of manufacturer, Baxter Medical, which was obliged to initiate a field safety corrective action to mitigate for vulnerabilities in the software. This was not the first report of such an event with infusion pumps being demonstrated to be hackable as early as 2015 (Zetter, 2015). 

I argued that, although Industry 4.0 promises many benefits, there are risks inherent to the technologies that underpin advancements in automation. One of these is the risk of personal information being accessed for exploitative purposes. 

As implied by Kyriacou (2023), these risks are not unique to the medical device industry: indeed, many sectors that depend on information systems experience similar vulnerabilities. An example is the financial sector, where there have been notable instances of data breaches (Kost, 2023). For this reason, cybersecurity should not be considered an issue pertaining exclusively to specific sectors. Rather, it becomes of general concern as industry embraces ubiquitous connectivity (Wysopal, 2021).

Rizzo (2023) enquired as to how the healthcare industry might tackle cybersecurity challenges. Separately, Lambert (2023) asked if there was a way to ensure vulnerabilities could be guarded against, specifically mentioning blockchain. 

Within the healthcare industry, products and services have to be developed under an assumption of vulnerability: it is no longer acceptable to assess the benefit/risk ratio of a product without also considering cybersecurity (Piggin, 2017). Though standards play an important role, the infusion pump example demonstrates that compliance with standards alone will not suffice. 

Strategies whereby personally identifiable information is decoupled from medical records may afford opportunities: this approach has been employed in randomised control trials for many years. Blockchain could present a suitable approach to achieving this and there are several published articles on its application in securing healthcare records (Aujla and Jindal, 2020; Rai, 2023; Xu et al, 2019;). 

Regardless of the strategies employed by developers, cybersecurity will be an ever-increasing focus of medical device manufacturers with the advent of Industry 4.0.
