## Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis enables the data analyst to become familiarised with the dataset: not only to discover trends or patterns in the data, but also to identify any missing or erroneous data, which can then be cleaned before using the dataset.

## Observations
EDA turns out to be an insightful exercise: not only is the process of interrogating the data interesting in itself, but the ways in which the data can be displayed and that patterns can be identified leads to further valuable insight.

## Worked example
I used Jupyter Notebook to work through the example in Unit 2:
