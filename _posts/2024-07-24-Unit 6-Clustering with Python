## Observations
The use of the k-means algorithm enables the unsupervised clustering of datapoints, allowing the analyst to identify patterns and trends in the data. The use of EDA is essential to prevent errors or missing data from impacting the analysis. This unit provided a way of experiencing the usefulness of this algorithm when dealing with a large, multi-parameter dataset.
